# Weather App

This is an application that retrives weather forecasts from two different APIs which include: 

- Hourly weather forecast
- Daily weather forecast
- 16 days weather forecast
- Dynamic background images related to current weather
- Highest and lowest degrees
- Other details such as humidity, wind speed, cloud cover and visibility
- Works on all iPhone screen sizes


I have developed this simple weather application project to improve my skillset on iOS. 

## Tech Stack

- Swift 5
- MVVM architecture
- Bond for reactive binding between Views and ViewModels
- URLSession
- Codable protocol
- CocoaPods
- Unit tests


## What could be improved

This project is still under-development. Therefore, this is a list of things to do next:

- Add more test coverage
- Error handling
- Implement Core Location Framework to get user's location
- Add location search feature (Currently, it is hardcoded - London only)
- Extend MVVM pattern to MVVM-C
